"""
This defines the Test class which is used both by the 
test program and the overarching CodeRunner class.

It is **not** used and definitions have been moved to chatrunner.py.
The intention is to use this as a submodule containing only the def's
used by the test program, but this is cumbersome during debugging
stages, and should be implemented later.
